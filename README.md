# Diploma-Projects-Management-App
A web application I developed with my colleagues.
We used Java, Spring Boot, Maven, HTML, Bootstrap and MySQL.
This web app allows students and professors to sign/log in and manage their profiles and courses. 
Students are able to apply for a thesis and get selected from the courseâ€™s professor.
